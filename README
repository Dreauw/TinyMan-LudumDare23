# Story
"Tiny Man is the story of Julien who just discovered a tiny world where you can become small" 


# Tools
For this game, I have used FlashPunk & as3sfxr. 
Also, I have used Audiotools for the music and Tiled for the map. 


# Tips
- For use the double jump, press the jump key (arrow up or W) and release it when you are high. 
- Don't be big if a wall is above or close, the hitbox is big too. 


# Other
The game was made in 23 hours.
